Sorting
In-place Algorithms:
       An algorithm that does not require extra memory or uses a small constant amount of extra memory to transform the input.
       Bubble Sort
       Selection Sort
       Insertion Sort
       Space-efficient, modifies the input directly.
  
Out-of-place Algorithms:
       An algorithm that requires extra memory to process the input or to store a modified copy of the data.
       Merge Sort
       Radix Sort.
       Often simpler to implement or avoids overwriting the input, but requires more memory.

Stable Algorithms:
      A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input.
      Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort 
      Stability is important when sorting complex data with multiple keys. 

Unstable Algorithms:
    A sorting algorithm is unstable if it does not guarantee the relative order of equal elements.
    Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort.
If stability is not required, unstable sorts may be faster or more efficient.

In-place: Modifies data within the same memory.
Out-of-place: Requires extra memory to manipulate or store data.
Stable: Preserves the order of equal elements.
Unstable: May not preserve the order of equal elements.
