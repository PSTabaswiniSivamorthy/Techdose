Bit Manipulation
1. Conversion of (1012) base 2 to base 10:
      To convert binary to decimal, multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position (from the right).
2. Conversion of (237) base 8 to base 2:
     Convert each digit of the octal number to its 3-bit binary equivalent.
3. Conversion of (535) base 9 to base 10:
     To convert from base 9 to decimal, multiply each digit by 9 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 from the right).

4. 1's Complement and 2's Complement:
           1's Complement: Invert all the bits of a binary number (flip 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
           2's Complement: Add 1 to the 1's complement.
Practical Application: 2's complement is widely used to represent signed integers in computer systems.

5.Representation of Positive and Negative Numbers**:
      Positive Numbers: Represented normally in binary.
      Negative Numbers: Typically represented using 2’s complement  
 
6.Binary Subtraction:  
  Use 2’s complement** for subtraction (add the negative of the second number to the first).

Leading and Trailing Zeroes:
  Leading Zeroes: Zeroes that appear before the first non-zero digit in a number 
  Trailing Zeroes: Zeroes that appear after the last non-zero digit 

Significant Zeroes:
 Zeroes that hold meaning in a number and contribute to its precision.
